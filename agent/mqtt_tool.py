mqtt_tool.py
-------------
MQTT communication utility for AI IoT Agent.

This module provides a lightweight MQTT client wrapper using the Paho MQTT library.
It handles connections, subscriptions, and message publishing between the AI Agent
and IoT devices such as ESP32. The class is designed for simplicity and easy integration
with LangChain-based intelligent agents.
